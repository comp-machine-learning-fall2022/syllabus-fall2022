<p>I am so excited that you’ll be joining this educational journey through
the computational aspects of machine learning! You are now, just by being here, a machine learning explorer and practitioner. This course will
help us frame out exactly what that means and also what <em>machine learning</em> is.</p>

<h2>Official Course Description<a class="headerlink" href="#official-course-description" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>An introduction to machine learning from a programming perspective. Students will develop an understanding of the basic machine learning concepts (including underfitting/overfitting, measures of model complexity, training/test set splitting, and cross-validation), but with an explicit focus on machine learning systems design (including evaluating algorithmic complexity and development of programming architecture) and on machine learning at scale. Principles of supervised and unsupervised learning will be demonstrated via an array of machine learning methods including decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, ensemble methods, and neural networks/deep learning as well as dimension reduction, clustering and recommender systems. Students will implement classic machine learning techniques, including gradient descent.</p>
<section id="motivating-questions">

<section id="course-philosophy">
<h2>Course Philosophy<a class="headerlink" href="#course-philosophy" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>This course is designed to be a first course in Machine Learning, but one that also prepares students to develop and implement their own machine learning pipelines using standard industry practices. Completing such a task is not as prescriptive nor as straightforward as completing a standard college course. There are turns and twists, failures and incremental progress, moments of confusion and bursts of clarity. Success in this course will be measured iteratively, placing emphasis on student’s ownership of the learning process and a student’s consistency of effort.</p>
<section id="stretch-zone">
<h3>Stretch Zone<a class="headerlink" href="#stretch-zone" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Borrowing language from the 2019 Google J-term course, when learning in a
classroom setting, at any moment, we exist in one of three zones: safe,
stretch, or strain. A student in the safe zone is completely comfortable, and
the course material is completely within what the student already knows. The
strain zone is the complete opposite of the safe zone. A student in the strain
zone feels completely overwhelmed with the material to the point where they
can’t find any meaningful connections between the current material and what
the student already knows.</p>
<p>The material in this course is intellectually challenging. Several of the
topics are ones that took me a long time to fully understand their subtleties. The goal for this course is to spend the vast majority of our time in the stretch zone. In this
zone, the material is just beyond our current knowledge base and while we are
a bit uncomfortable with the material, we can see possible paths to tie the
new material into our existing knowledge. In other words, in this class, our
brains should be stretching, but not straining.</p>
<p>At the end of each week, if you have not been surprised or challenged, or if
you have no questions about the material, this could mean that you are in the
safe or strain zones. If you find yourself exasperated or negative about the
class, you may be in the strain zone. If you find yourself using words like
“boring” or “easy”, you are likely in the safe zone. If you are in either
zone, please get in touch with me: in class, on slack, in an appointment, or
send me an email. I want you to get the most out of this course, but I cannot
make adjustments to the course if I do not have firsthand knowledge of what is
going on.</p>

<h2>Syllabus<a class="headerlink" href="#syllabus" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>This webpage and the associated links together function as the syllabus.
Everything that you need to know about the course is either here or linked from here.</p>
<p>The course syllabus is the most important document underlying the culture of
our course and our classroom. I view my syllabus as a sacred document that
both introduces and governs the course. In taking this view, I work to detail
as much about the course as possible from the big picture ideas to the minute
details of course policies. I believe that the first activity a student should
do when beginning a course is to carefully read and examine the syllabus. In
keeping with that belief, there are a few tasks in this document that will
help us build our course community.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Please read the syllabus this week and complete these tasks to help shape our community. If you have questions about the syllabus, please ask them on our <a class="reference external" href="https://bit.ly/3cNs0q1">class’s first week’s sli.do</a></p>

<h4>Attending Lecture<a class="headerlink" href="#attending-lecture" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>We are still in the midst of a global pandemic. In keeping with the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.smith.edu/covid-19">COVID-19 Information</a> laid out in
Smith’s Culture of Care, if you are ill and/or have <em>any</em> COVID symptoms,
please do <strong>not</strong> come to <em>in-person</em> class. Instead, please log in onto our zoom back-up.
The link can be found on our Moodle site and our slack space.</p>
<p>You do not need to email me to ask permission to come to class on zoom or in person. However, if you are not able to be in-person for 2 consecutive meetings, then we need to check in.</p>
<p>Similarly, do not come to student hours nor appointments if you are ill and/or have <em>any</em> COVID symptoms. Please use the gather to attend student hours virtually, and a zoom link can be provided for any in-person appointment.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>

<h4>Pivoting Class Meetings<a class="headerlink" href="#pivoting-class-meetings" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>If I am unwell and/or experiencing any symptoms of COVID, class will be held on zoom. If this happens, I will send a slack message on the #general channel using the &#64;everyone mention. Using &#64;everyone should send an email to your inbox.</p>
<p>If the college pivorts to remote learning, the course should be able to remain largely remain unchanged. The structure of this course is similar to one that I used in Spring 2021 for <em>Computational Machine Learning.</em> That course was fully online, and students had positive comments on this format.</p>

<section id="communication">
<h3>Communication<a class="headerlink" href="#communication" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>In addition to our synchronous meetings, our class will make of electronic communication, including our class slack, email, and Moodle messages. These methods of communication represent differing levels of formality and collaboration:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Slack:</strong> Our slack site is the <strong><em>primary form</em></strong> of course communication. It allows for us to share where we are stuck with a reading, idea, or assignment, and where we can add helpful hints, request study groups, or share interesting news articles. Slack is much less formal than email, and salutations and signatures are not required. If you need to ask your instructor a question, this is the best place to do it either over a public channel or through direct message. <strong>Please make a daily practice of checking slack as the <strong>primary</strong> form of communication for the course</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Email:</strong> Email communication is more formal than slack. It should be used in the cases that 1) concern something personal including <strong>accommodations forms,</strong> 2) require attachments, or 3) involve a number of people (who should be copied on the email). We also will use email to confirm individual appointments. Emails to the instructor should include a salutation (ie. “Dear…”) and a signature (ie. “Best/Cheers/Kindly…”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Slack Mentions:</strong> When I need to communicate with the whole class on a time-sensitive manner, I will use the &#64;everybody or &#64;channel functionality in slack. Please check that your slack settings will notify you either via slack or email. If you are using the email notifications, please be sure that your email does not treat these messages as spam.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Slack Emojis:</strong> At times, I will ask you to emoji a message to show that you have read the message. This is a quick way for you to signal that you read it. If there’s something that you have a question about in a “please emoji” message, please use the threading function for that message or send me a direct message on slack.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Please sign up for <span class="xref myst">our slack site</span>, add a profile picture, and introduce yourself with your name and a fun-fact about yourself on the #intros channel. After signing up, please determine how and where you will get notifications from slack.</p>
</div>
<p>Please note that on a typical workday, I leave my office just after 5:00pm. This means that emails and slack messages sent after 5:00pm will likely be received on the next business day. Similarly e-communication sent on the weekend will likely not be received until Monday.</p>
</section>
<section id="course-resources">
<h3>Course Resources<a class="headerlink" href="#course-resources" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field, and a course focusing on computation (instead of theory) is less common. So, our course will gather together a number of readings and resources from different sources. The below list of course materials are the minimum that I believe that you need to be successful in the course. If you feel that there is something critical missing from this list, please let me know.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Variety of book chapters noted on the detailed course schedule and available at the library</p></li>
<li><p>Bound notebook for notes, ideas, and scratch work</p></li>
<li><p>Highlighters in at least 2 colors</p></li>
<li><p>Pens or pencils in at least 3 colors</p></li>
<li><p>Recommended Texts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/smith/detail.action?docID=5061179">Python for Data Analysis</a> by McKinney</p></li>

<p>The work in this course can be broadly broken down into five types that build on each other:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Reading and Prep work for class</strong> - This is your first contact with the material. Just like meeting a person for the first time, you should pay attention to the big picture pieces, but not fuss over learning each detail perfectly. Instead, note questions you want to ask in your engagement journal the next time you come into contact with the material</p></li>
<li><p><strong>In class Labs</strong> - The course is designed to be largely hands on. Each class meeting will be mostly working on labs and talking about the labs. The labs are in jupyter notebooks so that we can play with small pieces of code that don’t impact other pieces, take tons of notes, and make mistakes! This is our second contact with the material, and just like meeting a person for the second time, you should have follow-up questions about the material</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weekly forms</strong> - Each week, you will complete a weekly reflection form that asks a few questions about the content from the week. These are designed to help you review the work from the previous week and to help you chart your progress through the course.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Homework</strong> - Once we’ve read about the material and worked on highly structured labs, it is time to practice deploying concepts from end to end in the usual python setting (i.e. not in a notebook). Homework is one step beyond the labs in difficulty because only the last step (i.e. the result) is asked for. You might want to refer to your labs to do these assignments and note the steps that you got hung up on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Projects</strong> - After three different interactions with each concept, it is time to start experimenting with mixing them and adding a bit of creativity. The projects in this course are very open-ended. The primary goal of these projects is to take the concepts from class and do something that stretches your knowledge.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The class all builds towards the <strong>Final Learning Portfolio</strong> that will be a collection of revised work for the semester.</p>
<section id="labs">
<h4>Labs<a class="headerlink" href="#labs" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The labs are designed to be completed in class with some work out of class to practice the ideas from our readings. The labs pull together a number of resources and require careful reading of the labs in addition to the code blocks. In addition to the interactive jupyter notebook format, a pdf version of each lab will be provided so that one can write notes by hand (or with a digital pen) on the labs directly.</p>
</section>
<section id="weekly-form">
<h4>Weekly Form<a class="headerlink" href="#weekly-form" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>Each week you will fill out a google form that asks you a few questions about your work this past week. These forms are designed to provide a reflective moment each week, where you can review the last week’s material before jumping into the next week.</p>
</section>
<section id="homework">
<h4>Homework<a class="headerlink" href="#homework" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>Homework assignments are designed to stretch your new machine learning knowledge. There are six homework assignments throughout the semester, and they pull together ideas from a number of the labs.</p>
</section>
<section id="projects">
<h4>Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#projects" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>There are three projects for the semester. The primary goal of these projects is for you to apply the concepts from this class to a topic that interests you. These are the most creative part of the course and as such, these projects have the least structure. It is highly encouraged that you start these projects early.</p>

<section id="workload">
<h4>Workload<a class="headerlink" href="#workload" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>According to federal standards, each four-credit course should equate to at least 180 hours of work over the semester. If you are taking 16 credits, that equates to 720 hours of work over the 15 weeks of the semester, from the first day of classes until the end of the final exam period. In the case of this course, you will spend nearly 12 hours each week on my class alone (including our three hours of class meetings per week).<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1">1</a></p>
<p>In considering the work for this course, I believe that the approximate 9 hours per week <em>outside</em> of class will breakdown something along these lines:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>2 hours of class prep</p></li>
<li><p>2 hours per week of lab wrap up</p></li>
<li><p>3 hours per week on homework and/or projects</p></li>
<li><p>2 hours of “flex time” used to supplement any of the above areas and/or go to student hours</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that there are 2 hours of flex time. This is to accommodate weeks were you might want to spend more time on an assignment. For example, you might spend extra time working on a project in the weeks leading up to its best by date.</p>
<p>If you find that the time you are spending on this class is a lot more than 9 hours per week <em>outside</em> of class or a lot less, let’s check in.</p>

<span id="document-honorcode"></span><section class="tex2jax_ignore mathjax_ignore" id="academic-integrity">
<h2>Academic Integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-integrity" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Nothing is held more dear to a researcher than their integrity. To researchers, the most precious commodity is our ideas. While some researchers build tangible items that can be protected by patents, many researchers’ products are ideas and theories, which are less likely to be protected under things like patents. Instead, it is academic integrity that governs our research communities, protecting our ideas from being stolen. The system of academic integrity relies on researchers trusting each other to be honest and to act with integrity.</p>
<section id="honor-code">
<h3>Honor Code<a class="headerlink" href="#honor-code" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Being at a school with an Honor Code, like Smith, is a special privilege. The Honor Code goes beyond inviting students to act with integrity, instead it welcomes students as equal participants of the learning community, imbuing students with the same level of trust that we extend to our collaborators and colleagues. The Smith College Honor Code, established in 1944, and as stated in the Student Handbook, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Smith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This trust bestowed to students in the Honor Code is the same trust that exists in and among researchers within a research community, the same trust that exists between me and my collaborators. Simply put, at Smith, under the Honor Code, I trust that you will each act with integrity, citing sources when you celebrate others’ ideas and noting who you work with when collaborating.</p>
<p>This trust manifests in how assignments are created, in how work is completed, and in how we resolve instances where the trust has been broken. At an Honor Code school, assignments are created knowing that while there are resources online that can offer complete solutions, you are trusted to not seek out such complete resources and that if you do stumble on a solution guide, you will not use it. Under an Honor Code, students are expected to keep careful notes about the resources that they consult and the people that they collaborate with. We get to assume that the work handed in by a student is the creation of that student. Lastly, when there are violations of the Honor Code, the resolution is determined by a committee established by the community and trusted to seek restoration of the whole community’s trust through education and action.</p>
<p>I regard the Honor Code with deep and profound respect. Being an educator at an Honor Code school means we begin from a place of trust without any underlying suspicion of our students. Simply put, we - instructors and students - work from the assumption that all are acting in good faith and with the utmost integrity. This is an assumption that cannot be made at a school without an Honor code, and it is why it is a privilege to be both an instructor and a student at Smith under the Honor Code.</p>
</section>
<section id="honor-code-practicalities">
<h3>Honor Code Practicalities<a class="headerlink" href="#honor-code-practicalities" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The work you submit should be your own and created by you, unless explicitly listed as a group assignment. With the exception of the starred problems, I do encourage you to ask for help from your peers or myself when you have questions; however, copying is never allowed. The line between copying and helping is subtle. Below are a few guidelines:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do not share nor give your work with other students; instead, offer to discuss the big ideas of the task at hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not look at someone else’s work (including online solutions); instead, ask if you could talk with them about your ideas and share where you are getting stuck.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge those you talk or work with at the top of every assignment. I will not dock points for getting acknowledged help from others. If you generate a solution or an argument with someone, in addition to acknowledging that person, recreate the solution or argument on your own in your own words.</p></li>
<li><p>While you are welcome to work with others, only submit work that you could recreate on your own <strong>without</strong> the person (or people) that you worked with. This means that you would retry the questions without looking at the code you built in collaboration with others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you think you may have crossed the line between helping and copying, please talk to me. Do not let me discover that the line was crossed. If a violation of the Honor Code is suspected, the student will be informed and will be given the opportunity to meet with the instructor. As recommended by the Academic Honor Board and in keeping with Smith tradition, the student will be given time to self-report, and after such time, the suspected violation will be reported to the Academic Honor Board by the instructor.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about how Smith’s Honor Code applies to our course, please consult with me or a class dean. We are happy to discuss the Honor Code with you.</p>
<section id="creation-vs-curation">
<h4>Creation vs. Curation<a class="headerlink" href="#creation-vs-curation" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>In my role as your instructor, I am <strong>curating</strong> resources for you that I feel are best for the teaching and learning of machine learning. In this process of curation, I will give credit to those whose materials I have used and I will only use materials as allowable by copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>In this course, you will be asked to <strong>create</strong> solutions for homework assignments and projects. In these acts of creation, you are demonstrating you most current understanding of the concepts in our course. This course will give you lots of chances to demonstrate what you know and lots of flexibility.</p>
<p>I am aware that there is a tension between the curation that I am modeling and the creation that is being asked of you. My goal is to provide the best resources to you, which requires reading and sorting through many sources (curation). Your goal is to learn as much machine learning as deeply as possible, which requires a lot of practice, trying out machine learning ideas, reflecting on your attempts, and trying again (creation).</p>

<span id="document-grading"></span><section class="tex2jax_ignore mathjax_ignore" id="assessment">
<h2>Assessment<a class="headerlink" href="#assessment" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>This semester, we will use a version of ungrading that culminates in a final learning portfolio. In this alternative grading strategy, you will be completing assignments (like labs, homeworks, and projects) as you normally would, but there are no explicit grades (like points or percentages). Instead you will get feedback on your submitted work that you will use to build your final portfolio.</p>
<p>Just like beginning a project, we begin this course with nothing completed yet, and so there is nothing to add to our learning portfolio, just yet. As assignments are assigned and returned we will slowly build learning artifacts and feedback on our work in concert with our knowledge about machine learning. In keeping with this philosophy, we view each assignment as a part of your growing machine learning knowledge base.</p>
<section id="grading-practicalities">
<h3>Grading Practicalities<a class="headerlink" href="#grading-practicalities" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>There are no numerical grades in this course. Instead, assignments will be completed with opportunities for feedback and reflection. There are three ways that we will do this:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Labs and weekly forms are expected to be completed in good faith. Completed in good faith means that you tried all parts of the assignment and that while it may not be perfect, you did your best to learn the material contained in the assignment. These learning activities are designed to serve as checkpoints towards the larger assignments.</p></li>
<li><p>Homework assignments and projects will undergo three rounds of reflection and feedback. The process is as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When you submit an assignment, you will fill out a rubric that asks you how comfortable you are with each part of the assignment</p></li>
<li><p>Then I will add a new rubric that marks each part as “started,” “progressing,” “meets expectations,” and “exceeds expectations.” This rubric aims to give you feedback on the quality of your work and is to be used to compare your comfort with the material (ie. the first rubric that you filled out).</p></li>
<li><p>Finally you will use both rubrics to decide which assignments you want to revise and how you want to revise them for your learning portfolio.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>While we have assignments that produce products that can be viewed and given feedback, learning in more than the physical artifacts. As such, a definition for course engagement will be determined by students in the course as well as assessed by each individual.</p></li>
</ol>
<section id="learning-portfolio1">
<h4>Learning Portfolio<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id3" id="id1">1</a><a class="headerlink" href="#learning-portfolio1" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The final product for this course is a learning portfolio that demonstrates both what you understand and what you can do in terms of machine learning. Another way to motivate this portfolio is to think of it as a github repo that serves as a quick introduction to your machine learning skills. This portfolio may ultimately be used as part of a job application or for graduate school.</p>
<p>The learning portfolio will be composed of revised activities from the semester. It will explicitly address the five course learning objectives in a coherent manner. The goal is to have one repo that shows the breadth of your machine learning knowledge in a compelling way.</p>
</section>
<section id="check-in-meetings">
<h4>Check-in Meetings<a class="headerlink" href="#check-in-meetings" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The course builds towards a learning portfolio, which will serve as the basis for your self-assessment of your learning and ultimately your grade. To support this kind of meta-cognitive learning and grading structure, there will be three meetings with the instructor throughout the term.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Mid-semester Check-in 1 (MSC 1):</strong> During the week of October 12, you will have your first mid-semester check in. At this point, you will have feedback from me on at least 2 of the homework assignments, and the goal of this meeting is to practice making the course learning objectives to your work in the course. In preparation for this meeting, you will fill out a form that asks a series of questions to help you map the learning objectives to the work you have done so far. The form will be your first time to qualitatively assess your progress so far and help you map out a path forward.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mid-semester Check-in 2 (MSC 2):</strong> During the week of November 21, you will have your second mid-semester check-in. This meeting will be very similar to MSC1, but you will have feedback on all 6 homework assignments and the first project. There are two goals for MSC2: 1) continue mapping course learning objectives to existing work, and 2) begin outlining the final portfolio and the work that you plan to revise for it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Final Check-in:</strong> The final check-in meetings are the time when we will discuss your final portfolio. These meetings will happen from December 5 through December 12, and are designed to be a time for you to share about your portfolio and to ask questions about it.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="final-course-grade">
<h4>Final Course Grade<a class="headerlink" href="#final-course-grade" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>In addition to the final portfolio, you will write a reflective essay on what you have learned in the course and ultimately assign yourself a grade. Your justification for your grade will draw on evidence provided in the final portfolio, but it can also be augmented with a discussion about your general engagement with the course. This means that instead of me–the instructor–assigning your final grade, you will be self-assigning your final grade.</p>
<p>However, for each flat grade, the below is a general completion expectation. Put another way, the below matrix is <em>guide</em> for how much work of each type should be <em>completed in good faith</em> for each of the listed grades. <em>Completed in good faith</em> does not mean that each assignment is perfect, but rather that you tried to complete each part. Note that pluses and minuses are not specified.</p>

<section id="translating-to-the-real-world">
<h5>Translating to the “real world”<a class="headerlink" href="#translating-to-the-real-world" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>When considering grading frameworks, I attempt to match my experience of being in the “real world” to the course assessment. Notice that in the framing above, the general expectation for an “A” student is that they will complete about 80% of the labs, forms, homeworks, and projects that need to be completed is about 80%. This means that in my opinion, to earn a top score in the course, you need to do about 80% of them in good faith to get full credit for 100% in that portion of the grade. This matches my daily life where I can physically get to about 80% of my to-do list. Under the second system, it is often easier to edit a draft than to start from a blank page, and having small deadlines (where the reward is quick feedback) gives structure to larger projects.</p>
<p>While I do believe that each assignment for this course is important, I also believe that the college structure does not always allow you to practice “real world” decisions such as balancing your health with your work. So while I will not tell you to hand in an assignment or to not hand one in, I would love to listen to you practicing making these decisions.</p>

<section id="due-dates">
<h4>Due Dates<a class="headerlink" href="#due-dates" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>Each week, there are two deadlines:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Homeworks and Projects are due <strong>Fridays at 5pm</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The labs and the form for the previous week are due <strong>Mondays at 10am</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>With the exception of Monday September 26, when this due date is pushed to Wednesday September 28.</p>
<p>The <strong>final learning portfolio is due on December 20 at 5pm.</strong></p>
<p>All of the course due dates are listed on the <span class="xref myst">Detailed Course Schedule</span>. This is a great moment to note these dates your system for keeping track of your work (ie. planner, calendar, etc). (If you want to really stretch here, do this for all assignments in all your courses.)</p>
<section id="flexibility">
<h5>Flexibility<a class="headerlink" href="#flexibility" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>In general, the labs and weekly forms build skills necessary for the homeworks, which build towards the projects. But the course builds flexibility around due dates in two ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In the course completion guidelines above, recall that only 80% of each type of assignment (labs, forms, homeworks, and projects) need to be completed in good faith to be considered for a top grade.</p></li>
<li><p>For homeworks and projects, you can take a <strong>self-granted extension.</strong><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id2">2</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>To activate a self-generate extension, you need to do three things:</p>

<li><p>You <strong>must</strong> code something on the assignment. The code does not need to be correct nor “work” but it <em>cannot</em> be just a comment.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to edit the README file for the assignment by adding a section at the bottom with five hashtags: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#####</span> <span class="pre">Self-granted</span> <span class="pre">extension</span></code> In that section, you will state that you are taking a self-granted extension and that you understand that you have until 10am on the following Monday to complete your work.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, you need to commit your changes (ie. both the readme and the edited code) to your repo <strong>before</strong> the deadline.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Under usual circumstances, there are no self-granted extensions for labs, forms, or the final learning portfolio.</p>
