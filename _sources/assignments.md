# Course Structure 

Each week will be a mix of reading about machine learning topics, discussing and debating concepts, implementing algorithms and ideas in code, and constant reflection about our learning and professional development. All due dates are posted on the Detailed Course Schedule.

## Assignments

The work in this course can be broadly broken down into five types that build on each other:   
- **Reading and Prep work for class** - This is your first contact with the material. Just like meeting a person for the first time, you should pay attention to the big picture pieces, but not fuss over learning each detail perfectly. Instead, note questions you want to ask in your engagement journal the next time you come into contact with the material   
- **In class Labs** - The course is designed to be largely hands on. Each class meeting will be mostly working on labs and talking about the labs. The labs are in jupyter notebooks so that we can play with small pieces of code that don’t impact other pieces, take tons of notes, and make mistakes! This is our second contact with the material, and just like meeting a person for the second time, you should have follow-up questions about the material   
- **Weekly forms** - Each week, you will complete a weekly reflection form that asks a few questions about the content from the week. These are designed to help you review the work from the previous week and to help you chart your progress through the course. 
- **Homework** - Once we’ve read about the material and worked on highly structured labs, it is time to practice deploying concepts from end to end in the usual python setting (i.e. not in a notebook). Homework is one step beyond the labs in difficulty because only the last step (i.e. the result) is asked for. You might want to refer to your labs to do these assignments and note the steps that you got hung up on.   
- **Projects** - After three different interactions with each concept, it is time to start experimenting with mixing them and adding a bit of creativity. The projects in this course are very open-ended. The primary goal of these projects is to take the concepts from class and do something that stretches your knowledge. 

The class all builds towards the **Final Learning Portfolio** that will be a collection of revised work for the semester. 

### Labs

The labs are designed to be completed in class with some work out of class to practice the ideas from our readings. The labs pull together a number of resources and require careful reading of the labs in addition to the code blocks. In addition to the interactive jupyter notebook format, a pdf version of each lab will be provided so that one can write notes by hand (or with a digital pen) on the labs directly. 

### Weekly Form 

Each week you will fill out a google form that asks you a few questions about your work this past week. These forms are designed to provide a reflective moment each week, where you can review the last week's material before jumping into the next week. 

### Homework

Homework assignments are designed to stretch your new machine learning knowledge. There are six homework assignments throughout the semester, and they pull together ideas from a number of the labs. 

### Projects 

There are three projects for the semester. The primary goal of these projects is for you to apply the concepts from this class to a topic that interests you. These are the most creative part of the course and as such, these projects have the least structure. It is highly encouraged that you start these projects early. 

 

## Weekly flow for the course 

Each week, you will have readings to prepare for class as well as two labs. Spread over the semester are six homework assignments and three projects. The course will operate as follows:

| Day    | Course Preparation and/or Activity | Due Date |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Monday     | Lab in class | Labs from previous week and weekly form |
| Wednesday     | Lab in class | |
| Friday     | (no class) | Homework or Project |

### Workload

According to federal standards, each four-credit course should equate to at least 180 hours of work over the semester. If you are taking 16 credits, that equates to 720 hours of work over the 15 weeks of the semester, from the first day of classes until the end of the final exam period. In the case of this course, you will spend nearly 12 hours each week on my class alone (including our three hours of class meetings per week).[^1]

[^1]: Each of our 75 minute meetings is "counted" as 90 minutes. Since we meet 2 times per week, our "in-class contact time" is counted as 3 hours. 

In considering the work for this course, I believe that the approximate 9 hours per week _outside_ of class will breakdown something along these lines:

- 2 hours of class prep 
- 2 hours per week of lab wrap up
- 3 hours per week on homework and/or projects
- 2 hours of "flex time" used to supplement any of the above areas and/or go to student hours

Notice that there are 2 hours of flex time. This is to accommodate weeks were you might want to spend more time on an assignment. For example, you might spend extra time working on a project in the weeks leading up to its best by date. 

If you find that the time you are spending on this class is a lot more than 9 hours per week _outside_ of class or a lot less, let's check in.
